# asOS Package Repository

Welcome to the official repository for asOS packages (`.spac` files)! This repository serves as a centralized collection of packages, scripts, and tools designed to extend the functionality of asOS.

## What is asOS?

asOS is a lightweight operating system inspired by the motives of the Absolute Solver from *Murder Drones*. It provides a simple yet powerful environment for running scripts, managing files, and executing commands.

## What are `.spac` files?

`.spac` files are package files specifically designed for asOS. They contain scripts, configurations, and resources that can be installed and executed within the asOS environment. These packages can add new commands, tools, or even entire applications to your asOS system.
